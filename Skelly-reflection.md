1. What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
> `fetch`

2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
> making `fetch` happen

3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
> wow, we sort of talked a lot. it was useful and fun! it's pretty late.  I asked the guide (Ryan) questions about how in depth we should go on certain answers. I asked my pairing partner Karia what we should write in our merge messages and what emojis were her favorite and what neighborhood does she live in. 

4. What still confuses you about Git?
> stuff we haven't done yet mainly, like backing up and un-merging and horrifying stuff like that.

5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
> totally awesome and way better than I expected. my pair was fun and funny and also, so was our guide Ryan now that I think about it. it was 99% less scary than I thought it would be.
