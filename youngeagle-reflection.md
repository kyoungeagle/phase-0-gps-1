1. What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

```git fetch```

2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

```mv .``` was clarified and it is now so much easier for me to move files!

3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

We asked the guide for lots of magic tricks. He shared some of his knowledge and expertise, especially about `.` and `..` 

I was having trouble navigating from my homescreen
*From this screenshare, can you tell why I'm being automatically directed to a DBC repo?
*How often do I initialize 'git'?

4. What still confuses you about Git?
The concept of repositories. My pair clarified this for me by saying, "A repository is ONE thing even though it lives on my computer, her computer, and GitHub.""

5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
Rating it a 10! I had a great time and learned a lot. My pair brought a great sense of humor, lots of knowledge, and patience. Our guide was friendly, personable, knoweldgable, and knew how to take a joke and joke about git puns (inadvertantly)
